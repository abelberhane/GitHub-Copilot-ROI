# Tracking ROI for GitHub Copilot Using APIs

To track metrics related to ROI for GitHub Copilot usage, you can focus on a few key API endpoints from the **GitHub Copilot Usage API** that give you insights into usage, acceptance, and productivity gains. Here’s a breakdown of the relevant API endpoints, grouped by the types of ROI metrics they can help you track:

## 1. Copilot Usage and Acceptance Metrics
These APIs provide data on how often Copilot is being used and how much of its suggestions are being accepted by developers. These metrics are critical for understanding engagement and productivity improvements, which directly impact ROI.

- **Endpoint**: [List Copilot seat assignment details for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-copilot-seat-assignment-details-for-an-organization)  
  - **Why Use It**: This endpoint provides a summary of how many seats are assigned to developers, which helps in determining Copilot adoption across your organization. More users assigned seats indicate that Copilot is becoming an integral part of your development process.

- **Endpoint**: [Get Copilot usage details for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-usage-details-for-an-organization)  
  - **Why Use It**: This API returns granular details on how often developers are using Copilot, how many code completions were generated, and how many of those suggestions were accepted or rejected. This is useful to track engagement and measure the efficiency Copilot brings to daily tasks.
  - **Key Metrics**:
    - **Total Code Completions**: How often Copilot is generating suggestions.
    - **Accepted Completions**: How often developers accept those suggestions, indicating Copilot’s usefulness and direct productivity benefits.
    - **Rejection Rate**: If the rejection rate is high, it may indicate that Copilot isn’t providing useful suggestions, which would impact the perceived ROI.

## 2. Productivity Metrics
These endpoints provide insight into how Copilot affects developer productivity, which is a key component of ROI measurement. By tracking productivity gains, you can quantify how much time is saved by using Copilot.

- **Endpoint**: [Get Copilot seat metadata](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-metadata)  
  - **Why Use It**: This API gives information on how seats are being used, including usage patterns over time. You can use this data to identify high-usage trends and productivity increases. This is especially useful when proving the frequency and impact of Copilot usage.

- **Endpoint**: [List Copilot seat assignment details for a user](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-copilot-seat-assignment-details-for-a-user)  
  - **Why Use It**: This API helps you track usage on a per-user basis, so you can assess the individual productivity gains for specific developers using Copilot. It’s a great way to see how Copilot impacts specific users and identify power users who may be driving a lot of value.

## 3. Quality and Code Review Metrics
To understand the quality of the code written using Copilot and its impact on development workflows, these APIs can help you track how code written with Copilot is being reviewed and integrated.

- **Endpoint**: [Pull Requests API (GitHub REST API)](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28)  
  - **Why Use It**: This isn’t specific to Copilot, but tracking pull request activity will help you understand how Copilot-generated code is being reviewed and merged. By comparing PR timelines (e.g., time to review or merge) with and without Copilot, you can measure the impact of Copilot on the overall speed and quality of code reviews.

- **Endpoint**: [Code Scanning and Security API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning)  
  - **Why Use It**: For organizations using **GitHub Advanced Security**, you can integrate this API to track code quality and security for Copilot-assisted code. This helps measure the reduction in bugs or security issues in code written with Copilot, a critical factor in proving ROI by showing that Copilot is contributing to more secure, cleaner code.

## 4. User Engagement and Adoption Metrics
To measure how well Copilot is being adopted and used by your team, these endpoints provide insight into user behavior and engagement trends.

- **Endpoint**: [List Copilot seat assignment details for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-copilot-seat-assignment-details-for-an-organization)  
  - **Why Use It**: By tracking how many seats are assigned and actively used, you can gauge adoption rates. Higher adoption typically correlates with better ROI, as more developers rely on Copilot in their daily workflow.

## 5. Custom Metrics and Analysis
While Copilot doesn’t have a dedicated API for productivity or time saved, you can calculate custom metrics by using external tracking tools and integrating with APIs that provide detailed usage data.

- **Combining Copilot Usage with GitHub Actions**: You can use GitHub Actions to trigger reports based on Copilot usage and feed this data into a dashboard that tracks productivity improvements over time. Automating reports on code completions, test success rates, and deployment frequencies can give you additional insights into Copilot's impact.
